# Learning Journal Entry 6 - class 201 - Day 8

It's really kicking off. Kicking off so that my original intention of how I was going to structure these journals
doesn't really fit the time constraints that I have. So I think as an adjustment I am going to stick to a more
journal feel and then write a bunch of documentation styled entries in the same section as a study guide both for myself
as well as anyone else since this repo is public. 

I'll hopefully get some time to work on it if I have extra time during a co-work or maybe to gather my thoughts during
the week off between courses


Salmon Cookies has been fun. The ability to start programming more complex applications has really stepped up the pace.
It has hammered in a lot of the concepts so the DOM itself is less of a mystery and makes a lot of sense. I really like
going through others code to see how they attempt the same problem. A lot of the structures are the same but the different
approaches to the same problem are really enlightening. It's kind of like a zen garden, you just have place to be with something
to exist and then it is done.

Adding forms to this iteration will be fun. I'll probably have to do even more re-working as the current solution I am thinking
of would require me to do my table rows a bit differently. Though I think I may see what I can accomplish with my current setup
before doing more editing.
