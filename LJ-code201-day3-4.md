# Learning Journal Entry 2 - Class 201 - Day 3-4

So far we have been going over the basics of primitive data types within Javascript. We have started out programming with developing a interactive guessing game script that takes user input.


### pseudo-code:
***

We have gone over how to outline your problems and start thinking like developers. We need to use pseudo-code to get generalized ideas to inform the directions we want to take as we design the program.

```javascript
for(starting val; condition; increment) {
    do something for a finite number of times
}

while(true) {
    do something until condition is false;
}

do{ 
    do this at least once until the condition is false
} while (condition)
```
Those are just some examples. You can replace the filler as long as it still fits the statement and makes sense. Sometimes you know the problem but need to just write it out in a pseudo fashion to make more sense of it and then proceed to flesh it out
