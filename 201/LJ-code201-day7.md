# Learning Journal Entry 5 - class 201 - Day 7

It's been an interesting experience populating an HTML page with nothing but javascript code. I learned that
I need to work more on my design abilities and think out overall layout before I start just manipulating the DOM.
I turned on application developer and just started working on the javascript construction not taking into account
how I would actually write it and design it. Coming from previous experience where the assets were fully designed
and I was just writing out formulas and tightening up elements, this really has shown what has been the most difficult 
part of this experience.

I need to work on a new system that allows me to still work the way I do for problem solving in the code and have more
of a designer mindset. I may need to think about bigger picture and fully fleshout basic outlines so I can have anchor points
to attach and guide the visual design better with my code design.

After I finish Lab 6, I think I am going to take a different approach with Lab 7 and re-write a bit of code (as i'll be doing it
anyway to incorporate the new constructor requirements) but also do more thinking about the layout of all the pages and design
and see how that will affect my table and page creation.
