# Learning Journal Entry 9 - class 201 - Day 11

It was very interesting to see how much more indepth we can get with the Web Dev Tools to help troubleshoot and debug the 
code we are working on. I think the next project is going to be fun to kinda wrap up everything we've learned and still
add a bit more to prepare us for the final projects.

The projects that have been posted so far for discussion have been really cool to see what people are thinking and what people
want to accomplish. I am interested to see if anything changes as we start and wrap up Bus Mall
