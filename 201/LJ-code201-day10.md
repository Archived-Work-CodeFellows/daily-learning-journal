# Learning Journal Entry 8 - class 201 - Day 10


I enjoyed todays code review. I always find it interesting to see how other people approach the same problem as I have but the small twists and changes to achieve the same goal are always exciting. It makes me re-evaluate my code and think about the different approaches I could have taken to achieve the same goal.

I find the math related items are relatively the same all around but the interaction with the DOM is where the differences exist. In between courses I may try and take some of these apart to see if I would change how I would approach the problem and come up with different ideas to achieve the same goals.

Also having the wire frame exercise I feel like that boosted my ability of what I need to understand for better CSS design. I am going to practice some more with just making some random wire frames to get better at managing margin combinations and different styling practices so I can keep expanding upon what I am learning with it.
