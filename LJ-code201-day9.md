# Learning Journal Entry 7 - class 201 - Day 9

I've managed to keep up with the main lab assignments and reading so this will be my first "late" assignment. I enjoyed the event handling lab a lot. Learning more about how javaScript interacts directly with the DOM is a really interesting concept. I also appreciated the wire frame examlpe to help layout webpages. I think that will help take my css t othe next level. 

After seeing the code review I realized that CSS is still weaker than my other programming abilities so I am gonna spend some time really trying to style the salmon cookies website so I can practice more of the different style concepts.
