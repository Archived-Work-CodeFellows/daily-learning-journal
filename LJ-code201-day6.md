# Learning Journal Entry 4 - class 201 - Day 6

This journal is going to be more about my thoughts on DOM rather than a full charted explanation. I had in the past
semi-tinkered with the DOM but not knowing it was the DOM rather just a website set up. Seeing more of the DOM in
action has kind of cleared up any confusion interms of how the whole browser and scripting works togethr to achieve that
interactive nature.

I'm viewing it as more of a flow rather than a straight up tree. There is this ebb back and forth in nature that gives
the DOM flexibility to achieve changes on a web page to effectivley convey a message or interaction to the user. It is
peaceful in a sense.

This has me thinking about some various projects that I am interested in pursuing and how it will impact recent side projects I've
already started with the intent of making interactive web pages.
