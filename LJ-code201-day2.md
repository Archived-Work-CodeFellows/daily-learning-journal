# Learning Journal Entry 1 - Class 201 - Day 1-2

Code Fellows makes me excited. It solidifies the fact that I am ready to jump back into the tech world and that I want to program. Today we started delving into git more. I find this incredibly useful as that I have kinda dabbled into the world of git but never really used it. Adding this to my toolkit will help not only start my journey towards being more employable, it just makes my programming practices more effecient, safer and smarter.

We are starting to get more into creating web pages. I've experience some CSS and HTML via the CMS Wordpress but I don't really have any working knowledge as to have far I can go. Since with this lab we have until Saturday, I am going to experiment with some CSS as I feel that is my weakest part as of right now. Really seeing how the different files (.css, .js and .html) interact will inform my organization of my future programs.

Looking forward to the next class.
