# Learning Journal Entry 1 - Class 301

From the article, I see my self as evaluating what skills I lack and need to polish in order to strive for the best outcome from being at CodeFellows. I haven't done any form of a mock interview yet but from the assignments so far, I need to work on my real-world problem solving skills i.e. Codewars. I think constantly challenging myself to new problems will continue to flex my solving abilities while still keeping me fresh on topics I should know about.

I think overall rank will be a good thing to look at the end of the 301 course. I am going to commit to at least a problem every few days (given my current work situation) and then switch it up to at least 1 a day. I'm also going to get more involved in the hosted events and meetups around the city once my time is up at my current position. I want to build a portfolio as another means of evaluating my current progress from taking these courses.
