# Learning Journal Entry 12 - class 201 - Day 14

This journal is super late. I am really feeling the combined affect of both working full time and taking these courses at night. I think if the course wasn't so condensed it would be a lot easier but then it would also take longer so I like what is currently happening just need to remember the little things like journals.

I enjoyed the quick store/order form lab we had to do as a group. It was a good test to try and make something work in a short amount of time. Definitely something I need to work on.
