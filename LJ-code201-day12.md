# Learning Journal Entry 10 - class 201 - Day 12

I found the code demo today to be very insightful with bus-mall. For me this has thrown the hardest problem of comparing multiple states against each other to prevent duplicates. I did manage to solve the problem with my own ideas but it took me a little longer than it has in the past.

With the code demo, I was really informative to see a different approach to the same problem. In the grand scheme my code also had the same basic concepts and conditional statements in the same place but the execution was different. This now has me thinking about how I should go about to optimize my current code to be more effecient and DRY. I think one step for that would to be combine my two comparing arrays into one multi-dimensional array to remove for-loops that are doing the same thing.

I am curious as to what the next lab will include.
